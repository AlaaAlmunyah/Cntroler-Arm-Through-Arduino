# Cntroler-Arm-Through-Arduino

This project is a web application designed to convert voice input into text and connect with an Arduino device to control a robotic arm. It includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to create a user-friendly interface and functionalities for voice-to-text conversion and Arduino connection.

## Features

- **Voice to Text Conversion**: The application captures voice input and converts it into text, displayed in a text area.
- **Arduino Connection**: It allows users to connect to an Arduino device via a USB connection, enabling interaction with a robotic arm.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, providing a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web application.
- **CSS**: Styling for the application, creating a visually appealing and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality for voice-to-text conversion and Arduino connection.
- **jQuery**: Used for simplifying JavaScript operations and handling events.
- **Arduino**: Integration with Arduino for controlling the robotic arm.
